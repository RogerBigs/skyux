<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


The moment module allows you to use [the Moment.js library](http://momentjs.com/) to handle dates in JavaScript.  SKY UX locale files automatically include their matching moment locale definitions.  When including a SKY UX locale file, the moment locale is also globally set.
