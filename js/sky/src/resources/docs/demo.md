<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


The resources constant and filter allow you to localize SKY UX components. `bbResources` mostly applies to component development. When you build SKY UX and need to render a string, you can inject the `bbResources` constant. When you inject `bbResources`, all locale strings are available on the `bbResources` object and in a `bbResources` filter. You can view the available local strings  on the [SKY UX GitHub repo](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/tree/master/js/sky/locales).
